Description:
	This script loads in an image defined by the user and converts it to a
	Xilinx Coefficients File (.coe)
	The majority of this code is just adapted from a MATLAB script, "IMG2coe8.m",
	that was found in an on-line example at: 
	http://www.lbebooks.com/downloads.htm#vhdlnexys
	The specific example is at:
	http://www.lbebooks.com/downloads/exportal/VHDL_NEXYS_Example24.pdf

TO USE:
	The easiest way to use this script is to copy this module to the directory
	that contains the image that you want to convert. Then  start and instance 
	or your terminal emulator or command prompt in that same directory. Run this 
	module with the python command from the terminal emulator or command prompt
	text editor and change the contents of the string named ImageName. 
	Then run the script from a command line.
